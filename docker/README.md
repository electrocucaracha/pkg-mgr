# Docker

Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use
OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called
containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their
own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate
with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run
by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than
virtual machines.
